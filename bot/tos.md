Sonic-SNAKES TOS V1.0 20/05/2024 20:50 UK 

Hey, thanks for checking the ToS. Nobody does.

Basically, please bear these things in mind:

Most of this code isn't mine (most devs can relate)
This software comes with NO WARRANTY
There WILL be bugs
I will attempt to fix these bugs but fixes/quality of fixes cannot be guaranteed
Uptime and overall service quality is NOT currently guaranteed 
Uptime is dependent on my laptop being online and me not currently experiencing a network or power outage
Loss of channels or messages MAY HAPPEN and Discord offers NO RECOURSE for these events
Features MAY BREAK with discord updates or codebase changes, hang tight if this happens
I use Windows to make this, which is a bad sign right out the gate

xoxo the developer foxruntime
questions? msg @foxruntime on x or discord
