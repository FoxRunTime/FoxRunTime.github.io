Sonic-SNAKES PRIVACY POLICY V1.0 20/05/2024

Thanks for checking out the Privacy Policy, nobody does that **EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD**

As a UK-based developer I'm required by some fuckass laws to look after user data to the best of my ability. 
Rest assured, I do not intend to sell user data or make use of it in any way besides improving the quality of the Software and providing the features you expect.
User data is stored on a local machine at this time and is NOT uploaded to the cloud ("other people's computers") in ANY WAY for ANY REASON, including storage, transfer, and peer review
If I need to migrate data to another machine, this will be performed using 'old-school' methods, such as physically moving it via external hard disk or USB flash drive. 
I AM SOLELY REPSONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR BREACH.
